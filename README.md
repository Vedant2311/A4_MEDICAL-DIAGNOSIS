# A4_MEDICAL-DIAGNOSIS

Some medical researchers have created a Bayesian network that models the inter-relationship between (some) diseases and observed symptoms. Our job as computer scientists is to learn parameters for the network based on health records. Unfortunately, as it happens in the real world, certain records have missing values. We need to do our best to compute the parameters for the network, so that it can be used for diagnosis later on

Here, a **.bif** format is used for the representation of these Bayesian Networks. The input file will be an alarm.bif file. Please go through the sample input file and the link below, for a better understanding of this format http://sites.poli.usp.br/p/fabio.cozman/Research/InterchangeFormat/index.html
